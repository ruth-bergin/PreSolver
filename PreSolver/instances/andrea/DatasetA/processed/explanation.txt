Scoring:
Positive numbers -> the number of appearances
-2 -> unit clause
-3 -> pure literal
-4 -> obsolete literal
-5 -> assignment made after solution found

Variable selection priority:
1. unit clauses
2. pure literals
3. DLIS (variable with highest number of literal appearances)

i.e. Units are automatically propagated after every single "manual" variable assignment, until there are none left.
Pure literals are top priority during branching, but still considered manual assignments.
DLIS is applied when there are no pure literals, or between the pure literals when there's more than one.
